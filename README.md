# Assembly Endgame

This is a fun capstone project from the Frontend Path at scrimba.com. It's a version of Hangman, but 
instead of Hangman you eliminate common programming languages. If you lose, you're stuck with Assembly!

How to play: guess a letter on your way to solving the random word! If your guess is correct, you 
lose no guesses. If it's wrong, one of the common programming languages disappears and you lost a guess.

Try to guess the language before all your left with is Assembly!
